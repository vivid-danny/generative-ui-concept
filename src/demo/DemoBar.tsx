/**
 * Demo chrome: the context switcher and the provenance panel. Not part of the
 * product being argued for, and styled so that is obvious at a glance.
 *
 * **Hidden by default — press Shift+H to show or hide it.** It opens as a left
 * drawer that pushes the page to the right rather than stacking above it: the
 * previous top bar shoved the product down the viewport, so switching context
 * meant closing the panel just to see what changed.
 *
 * Visibility is local state only, and starts closed. It is deliberately not
 * reflected in the URL: a query param survives navigation, which meant hiding
 * the bar and then switching context brought it straight back.
 *
 * The provenance half exists because slice 1 composes ahead of time rather than
 * at request time. "An LLM composed this" would otherwise be an unverifiable
 * claim; here the model, prompt version, generation timestamp and raw response
 * are on screen, alongside every drop or repair the validator made.

              Briefs already typed on this machine, from the call ledger. A
              typed brief lives in the URL and nowhere else, so without this the
              composition you paid for becomes unreachable the moment you switch
              tabs — it is still on disk, under a hash.

              Each says whether it replays for nothing or costs a call. Same
              brief, both answers possible: editing the system prompt or the
              catalog invalidates every key.

              A column beside the drawer rather than a layer over the product.
              The drawer pushes the page right instead of covering it, and a
              panel opened to fix "I cannot read the output" has no business
              covering the output.
